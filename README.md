## What I learned 
I learned alot doing this project and i was able to solved an error that i encounter while using leaflet
which is the map(html elemtent) which i use to render the map will be initailized once the map is added to the element and it can not be un-initialized  but i was able to fix it by removing and adding back the map(HTML Element) everytime a request is made to rest country api to get the lat and lng of the country then use the coordinate on leaflet to render the map 
Above all i learned alot a it was fun doing this project
